# checkStrongPassword
Flag Write an “active password checker” in PHP. The purpose of an active password checker is to prevent the user from selecting a password or password phrase that is easily guessed. This may be done by comparing potential passwords with a dictionary, examining the mix of characters selected, checking user information, and so on.  Your active password checker must:  Make sure that the selected password is at least 8 characters in length.  Use a dictionary of bad passwords and a rule base, so that you exclude passwords that match known "bad" words. For the words in the bad password dictionary, you may construct your own dictionary as long as it contains at least ten entries which are bad passwords. Bad words are passwords that are easily guessed. For example, "test," "1234567," "help," " (blank)," and "password."  You may use any implementation technique that you want. Feel free to experiment with PHP features and programming techniques.
